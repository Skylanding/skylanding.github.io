# The Last Day of February 2026, Spring Is Finally Here

Today I revived my long-dormant blog. Back in 2024 I used to jot down casual essays and course notes, but as things got busier and the PhD application grind wore me down, the habit faded away — along with my evening runs.

In 2026 I've decided to pick them both back up. After four brutal months of cold and a winter storm that swept the entire East Coast, DC finally greeted spring on the last day of February. Yesterday I walked through Georgetown and across the bridge again, and slowly I found myself recalling those nights years ago on Luojia Hill — running under a dark sky, feeling the cool breeze, wondering where life would take me.

Since 2024 there has been plenty of bad news and plenty of good. I received a few offers, chose the one that felt right, spent three months at Westlake, and then rushed off to DC. At the time I thought my application strategy was a bit of a failure — I didn't listen to my family's advice to apply for an MS as a stepping stone. Fortunately my advisor turned out to be incredibly kind and supportive; I figured I'd just publish papers and work toward a degree.

Half a year has passed in the blink of an eye. Some of the work left over from undergrad has started to bear fruit, and sometimes I can't help wondering: if I were doing an MS right now, a year's worth of accumulated results might have carried me to a better platform. But as Frost wrote, two roads diverged in a wood — once you pick one, you'd better walk it with both feet on the ground. With that mindset, I keep pressing on.
